🐳 Dockerfile Generator
A GenAI powered tool that generates optimized Dockerfiles based on programming language input. This project uses gemini with the generativeai package to create Dockerfiles following best practices.

💡 How It Works
    1. The script takes a programming language as input (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java)
    2. Connects to the gemini API through generativeai package imported
    3. Generates an optimized Dockerfile with best practices for the specified language
    4. Returns the Dockerfile content with explanatory comments
